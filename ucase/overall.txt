Understand:
Make a fully featured library checkout system. Allow checkouts and check-ins of books, and full view and manipulation of book objects. Create a simple CLI and GUI for management. Follow best practices using Ruff.

Clues:
The module datetime should be used to set checkout dates. Tkinter should be used for GUI. Classes should be used for book management.

Examine:
The code is pretty performant, readable, and functional. It has all the features of a basic library inventory system, and with a few more tweaks could be used as a real system. One problem it has is that each copy does not retain it's due date information when being saved to file and when user inputs it. Another problem is that when checking out or returning books, you can't pick the specific copy that gets checked out, it's the first one in the list. Also, the CLI could be improved for usability. Other than that, there aren't really any problems. If I had more time, I would've continued until Level 7 instead of stopping at Level 6 and fixed the mentioned problems.
