Understand:
Allow the user to search for books, and return books with exactly matching authors or genres. It should be exactly matching since a later feature says partial search. It should be case insensitive.

Clues:
It says return, so this function will have to return a list instead of printing. I'll use .lower() since it says case insensitive.

Assemble:
function search_books(query):
    matching_books = []
    for book in library_books:
        if author is equal to query.lower or if genre is equal to query.lower:
            append book to matching_books
    return matching_books

Solve:
The code is in main.py under the level 2 comment.

Examine:
The code is functional and performant, but is not very readable. Instead of using .lower() on the query in the if statement, I could have reassigned query to query.lower(). And instead of doing book["author"].lower() I could have made a variable called author equal to that and used it in the if statement, further improving readability.
