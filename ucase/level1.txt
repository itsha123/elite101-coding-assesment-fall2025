Understand:
Create a function that prints all available books with their book ID, title, and author.

Clues:
I will have to iterate through the list of books using a for loop to print all of them. I will use prettytable to make it look better.

Assemble:
function show_available_books():
    table = prettytable
    table.toprow(Book ID, Title, Author)
    for book in library_books:
        if available:
            table.append(bookid, title, author)
    print table

Solve:
The code is in main.py under the level 1 comment.

Evaluate:
The code is pretty streamlined, performant, and readable. Maybe an "Available Books" title for the table might be useful.
