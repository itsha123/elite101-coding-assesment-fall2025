Understand:
Create a function that prints all available books with their book ID, title, and author. When going from assemble to solve, implement any suggestions by Ruff.

Clues:
I will have to iterate through the list of books using a for loop to print all of them. I will use prettytable to make it look better.

Assemble:
function show_available_books():
    table = prettytable
    table.toprow(Book ID, Title, Author)
    FOR book IN library_books:
        IF book[available]:
            table.append(book[id], book[title], book[author])
    PRINT table

Solve:
def show_available_books() -> None:
    """Display all available books in a table format."""
    # Create table with headers.
    table = PrettyTable()
    table.field_names = ["Book ID", "Title", "Author"]

    # Append row to table for each available book.
    for book in library_books:
        if book["available"]:
            table.add_row([book["id"], book["title"], book["author"]])

    # Show table.
    print(table)

Examine:
The code is pretty streamlined, performant, and readable. Maybe an "Available Books" title for the table might be useful.
