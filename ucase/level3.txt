Understand: Check if book is available. If not, print a message. If so, set book as unavailable, increment book's checkout number, and set due date two weeks from now.

Clues:
The instructions say to use datetime, so I'll use datetime to find the current date, and since timedelta was imported in the starter code, i'll use that to find the date two weeks from now.

Assemble:
function checkout_book(book_id):
    for book in library_books:
        if id of book is equal to book_id
            if book is unavailable:
                print Book is unavailable.
            else:
                set book as unavailable
                increment book's checkout number
                set book duedate to datetime.now() + timedelta(weeks=2)

Solve:
def checkout_book(book_id):
    # Find the book by ID
    for book in library_books:
        if book["id"] == book_id:
            # Check if book is available
            if not book["available"]:
                # Print unavailable message
                print("Book is unavailable.")
            else:
                # Set book availability to false, increment checkouts by 1, and set due date to 2 weeks from now
                book["available"] = False
                book["checkouts"] += 1
                book["due_date"] = datetime.now() + timedelta(weeks=2)

Examine:
The code is functional and performant, but is not very readable. Maybe some blank lines might have helped, but due to the code structure in this case there isn't much that can be done.
